# Lab 13
### Basketball
**_Objective:_** 
To use a two-dimensional array.

**_Assignment:_**

A basketball scoreboard has the following form.  The eight “quarter” slots contain the number of points scored in each quarter by each team.  The “halftime” and “final” slots contain the point totals at halftime (after the first two quarters) and at the end of the game.  See the partial sample run further down the page for an example. 


Write a program using a **minimum of three functions besides the main** that helps to keep track of the score during basketball games.  **Use a two-dimensional array** of integers to store the scores.  

The program should do the following:
+ *Each quarter*, ask the user for the number of points scored by each team (Visiting, then Home). 
+ Calculate the halftime score and final score.
+ Display the quarter, halftime, and final scores in a scoreboard grid.
+ Determine and display who won.
+ Determine and display the quarter in which the most total points were scored (by both teams collectively) and the number of points scored during that quarter.

**Note:** *You* will decide how the program gets the user input (exact wording/formatting, etc.). Make sure the directions are clear and easy to follow and that you are asking in the correct order, as described above.
The scoreboard and other information should be displayed as shown below.

**_Partial Sample Run_**
Notice there are not perfect lines in this grid, just pipes ( | ) and dashes (-). You can use `setw(5)` and 3 spaces after each number to help things line up as nicely as possible.
