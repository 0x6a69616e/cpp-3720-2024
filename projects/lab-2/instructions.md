# Lab 2	
### House
**_Objective:_**
To become familiar with C++ programs and with the `cout` command by modifying an existing program.

**_Assignment:_**

**Part 1:**  Copy the code below by typing into your main.cpp. The comment header you see at the top will be there on all future labs. **Be sure to fill in your name and block every time!** Run the program and make sure the output shown in the console looks like a proper house.

**Part 2:**  Now modify the house: add a door, window, chimney, and/or anything else you please.  Be creative!

**_Notes:_**
+ Backslash (`\`) cannot be used on the roof in place of the hyphen because the backslash symbol has a special meaning in C++ (denotes special character).  To obtain a backslash for output you need two (`\\`) in your code.  
+ The `\n` used above is a shortcut for the  `endl` command, but it must be inside the quotes.
+ Careful! A tab used for spacing, may produce unexpected results in your house. 

**Part 3:**  Edit the program so that it displays the name of the house’s owner (that’s you!) centered under the picture as best you can.

**Submit:** There are no tests for this lab since everyone's house & name will be unique. Check the Scoring Guide (under Files on the left) to make sure you have completed all the requirements of the lab (this is something you should do for every lab). Then submit your work by clicking the button at the top right.
