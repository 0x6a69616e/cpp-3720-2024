# Lab 9
### Box Surface Area and Volume

**_Objective:_**
To write a program with:
 + a function to do necessary calculations that will **return** the answer

**_Assignment:_**

Write a program that will prompt the user for the dimensions of a box (length, width and height), convert all of the units to inches, and output the surface area and volume of the box.


The program **must** contain a function that:
- Takes in a value and its unit type (letter)
- Converts that value to inches
- Returns the converted value

There should **not** be a separate function for each dimension!  The conversion function should not care if the dimension it is converting is the length, width or height. It only needs to know the value and units that are to be converted.

_Note:_ your values may be off by a decimal point or two due to rounding of conversion factors (so it's okay if you fail a test for that reason alone). There is no need for `setprecision` commands here though.

Check the scoring guide to make sure you have satisfied the lab requirements before submitting your work.
