### Gallons of Paint

**_Objective:_**
To write a program with different kinds of variables and different calculations

**_Assignment:_**
To earn some money for college, you have started painting house interiors.  To determine how many gallons of paint are needed for a job, you estimate that one-gallon of paint covers 400 square feet of surface.  Since windows and doors require different paint than the walls or no paint at all, you deduct 15 square feet for each window and 21 square feet for each door in the room.  Also, knowing that ceilings are sometimes painted differently than walls, you decide to calculate only the number of gallons of paint needed for the *walls* (a different painter will take care of the ceilings). 


Your program needs to get the following information from the user:

* length, width, height (room dimensions to the nearest foot)
* windows, doors (number of windows and doors in the room)

The program should calculate and display the gallons of paint needed for the room.  Think about the kinds of variables you need (whole numbers? numbers with decimals?).  Since paint is normally sold in gallon containers, your program should also show how many gallon containers should be purchased. *Remember:* You are not painting the ceiling or the floor.

**_Reminder:_**
When starting a new assignment in Replit, don’t forget to add your name and block at the top of the code!

**_Sample Run:_**	
When you run your program, your output should look exactly like this when the numbers shown in bold below are entered by the user.
