# Lab 10
### More Gallons of Paint

**_Objective:_**
To write a program with:

+ a function to get input from the user (variables must be passed **by reference**)
+ a function or functions to do necessary calculations
+ a function of your choice

**_Assignment:_**

You are going to modify your program from lab 4 so that it will more efficiently use functions for each portion of the code. Make sure you are writing a new program here and copying any code from lab 4 you need (donâ€™t modify your lab 4 program directly so you still have a record of what you did back then).

The program must contain **at least 3 functions** beyond the main function:  
+ One of the functions should get the necessary input about the room from the user (variables must be passed **by reference**).
+ Another function should **return** the gallons of paint needed for a given room. That function should accept the following parameters:
  +  length, width, height (room dimensions in feet)
  +  windows, doors (number of windows and doors in the room)
+  The other function(s) are your choice.

The program will also now calculate a running total of the gallons needed to paint several rooms of a house.  The program should display the paint needed for each room as well as the total (rounded to 2 decimal places).  Since paint is normally sold in gallon containers, your program should also show how many gallon containers should be purchased for the entire job.
